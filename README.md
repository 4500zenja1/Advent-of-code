Welp, here is my README text — here I'll be posting all solutions I used for solving Advent of Code' problems (https://adventofcode.com).

There were input files too, but because of the Reddit post (can't remember the exact link) they're not recommended for posting to Git, so only coding :D

All process is made on Repl.it, all functions are main.py, all text_files are input.txt (yeah, I have little imagination for that, but it's partially Replit's fault lol)

Anyways, when I will complete 2022 year, I *maybe* will do the same thing for the other years, just because reason :>
